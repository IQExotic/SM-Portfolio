# Marketing Manager Portfolio

This site is a portfolio for Marketing Managers (it can also be used as a portfolio for other professions). *Please note that I am not primarily a frontend developer; I created this website as a fun project.*

## Usage Guidelines

Feel free to use this website as a template for your own portfolio, but please give proper credit. You are allowed to change the content, such as images and text.

## Custom Websites

If you are interested in a custom website tailored to your needs, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to discuss your project and how I can help.

## To Do

This is an early version that I built quickly. I have not yet had the time to perfect the design and functionality of the website. Currently, the website is not responsive to small screens. I will work on improving this as soon as possible. If you encounter any issues with the site, please let me know and feel free to create an issue here on GitHub.
